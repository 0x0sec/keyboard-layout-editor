================================

There is an increasing trend towards using non-plastics to make custome keyboards.

For example, see

To this end, KLE provides a selection of backgrounds which may possibly be used to aid in designing such keyboards.

These backgrounds are all big enough for standard layouts ... just be sure to set the size of the background 
to prevent unwanted tiling. The standard ANSI 104 fits happily into a 1250 px background.

Materials currently in the lineup are:

Carbon fibre
Leather
Metal
Plastic
Wood

The backgrounds were sourced from various sites around the web and are believed to all be
free to use. If you feel your copyright is being infringed, please advise and the offending 
material will be removed.

The source materials were generally used as follows:
  in some cases of close-up photos, reduced 50% x/y, and/or
  rotated, and/or
  cropped to around 2000x1000 px, and/or 
  used as-is.
 

The plastic backgrounds were created by selecting a small, defect-free region of photographs of Signature Plastics colour
samples, and making them into seamless tiles in Gimp. 

While Signature Plastics does NOT make keyboard cases, the technique provides a useful selection of 
plastic colours used by others in making keyboard cases. It also opens up the possibility down the 
road of using the textures as backgrounds to the keys themselves.


Most of the following materials are from bgfons.com:
Aluminium, Carbon fibres, Titanium, Iron/Steel, Marble, Leather:
